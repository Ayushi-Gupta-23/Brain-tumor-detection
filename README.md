# Brain-tumor-detection
Brain tumor detection is an innovative application of AI in the medical field. In the context of brain tumor detection, deep learning can assist in the early and accurate identification of brain tumors in medical images such as MRI or CT scans. The project uses deep learning techniques to classify whether there is a Brain tumor or not. This model achieves an accuracy of 84.6%.
